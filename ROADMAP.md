# Roadmap for conlang.app

## Guiding Principles

- **Instant gratification first**: User sees believable output in minutes.
- **Progressive depth**: Advanced rules appear only when needed.
- **Offline-first**: Drafts always work without an account.
- **Deterministic**: "Generate" never feels random-chaotic once a user likes a vibe.
